# Code Challenge: Calculator

Hi, my name is Gustavo Sales and this is the project to Nubank's Calculator Challenge :)

## A little about

The main stack of this project is React. I choosed all of this, because it is a powerful framework, a lot of big companies use, it can make all process easily and have a giant community.

I have used some libraries to help the develop and test, like "create-react-app", "jest", "enzyme", "react-currency-input" and others.

## About the challenge

Some commands to help:

### To install

```
npm i
```

### To run
```
npm start
```

#### IMPORTANT: To test JSON inputs
You will see at `./src/components/calculator/index.js` line 23 a `TODO` comment.

To test with wrongs values, please, comment the require which has the `correct-input.json` and uncomment the require which has the `wrong-input.json`

You can see the output on browser's console.

### To test
```
npm t
```

## Last words, for now

Thanks for the opportunity, and thanks for read until here, see you around :)
